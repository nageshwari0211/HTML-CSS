        <h2>SECTION ONE</h2>
        <p>Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry is a fictional boarding school of magic for young wizards. It is
            the primary setting for the first six novels in the Harry Potter series by J. K. Rowling, and also serves as
            a major setting in the Wizarding World media franchise.In the novels, Hogwarts is described as a
            coeducational, secondary boarding school that enrolls children
            from ages eleven to eighteen. According to Rowling, any child in Britain who shows magical ability is
            invited to attend the school. The Wizarding World website states that Hogwarts was founded in the
            Highlands of Scotland sometime between the 9th and 10th century by Godric Gryffindor, Helga Hufflepuff,
            Rowena Ravenclaw and Salazar Slytherin. Rowling has offered varying accounts of how many students are
            enrolled at Hogwarts at any given time.</p>

            Minerva McGonagall. The Gryffindor dormitories are in a high tower, and students must use a password to gain

            work, patience, justice, and loyalty. Hufflepuff's mascot is a badger, and the Head
            of House is Pomona Sprout. Rowling said that Hufflepuff corresponds roughly to the element of
            earth.Ravenclaw values intelligence, learning, wisdom, and wit. The house mascot is an eagle in the novels
            and a raven in the Harry Potter and Fantastic Beasts films. In the novels, the Head of Ravenclaw House is
            Filius Flitwick. The dormitories are in Ravenclaw Tower, and students must solve a riddle to gain entry.
            Ravenclaw corresponds roughly to the element of air.Slytherin values ambition, cunning, leadership, and
            resourcefulness. The mascot of Slytherin is a serpent.
            Severus Snape is the Head of Slytherin House until he becomes headmaster, at which point Horace Slughorn
            assumes the position. The Slytherin dormitories are accessed by speaking a password in front of a stone wall
            in the dungeons, which causes a hidden door to open. Slytherin corresponds roughly to the element of wate

        <h2>SECTION THREE</h2>
        <p>The Grand Staircase, also known as the Moving Staircase, was a massive stairway in Hogwarts Castle, the
            structure was mainly used to access each floor of the castle, including the dungeons. Rowena Ravenclaw
            was the Hogwarts founder who invented the concept of moving stairs. The staircases led from platform to
            platform and went as high as the seventh floor, where they came to an end. The stairs also had a knack for
            moving around the staircase chamber, usually when a student was walking up one of them. There were also many
            trick stairs that caused the victim to sink through a step and required another person to pull them out.
            However, it was second nature to most of the older students to jump them.</p>

        <h2>SECTION FOUR</h2>
        <P>A Whomping Willow was located on grounds of Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. It was planted in
            1971 to disguise the opening of a secret passage leading from the Hogwarts grounds to the Shrieking Shack, a
            building located in the village of Hogsmeade. A very violent plant, it was known to attack anyone who
            disturbed its branches.</P>

        <h2>SECTION FIVE</h2>
        <P>The Hogwarts Express was the name of the train that ran between London King's Cross Station Platform 9¾ and
            Hogsmeade Station. It made this run about six times a year, maybe more, as needed. It also made the run back
            again to London at the end of term in June. The Express dutifully carried students of all years to and from
            Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. It travels at the start and end of every term. It is the
            school's primary method of travel.The train left Platform 9¾ without fail every 1 September at 11 o'clock in
            the morning, arriving at
            Hogsmeade Station in the early evening. Some students took the train back to King's Cross Station to go home
            for the Christmas and Easter holidays, but some did not, as they stayed at Hogwarts.</P>
